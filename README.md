# Mastering DSA and the interview with leetcode

My plan is based around [The Tech Interview Handbook](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75/?hours=7&weeks=26&grouping=topics). I plan to do the depth then breadth approach where I learn each topic then start to add new ones until completed. From there I should be able to answer many leetcode/interview questions. You can track the journey here! Any input or recommendations is appreciated!
